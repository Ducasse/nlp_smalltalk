## Setup

Change directory to of your Pharo Smalltalk installation and performa git pull on this project:

  git clone https://github.com/mark-watson/nlp_smalltalk.git
  
On a Mac, change directory into the App folder that defines the Pharo application: Contents/Resources. On my system this is:

  cd ~/Pharo3.0.app/Contents/Resources


## Running an example

Open a File Browser and fileIn the KBSnlp.st source file. Open a Class Browser
and and look at the code in the KBnlp class.

Open a Workspace and one time only evaluate:

    NLPtagger initializeLexicon

Note (5/2/2014): after the text file is processed, the lexicon dictionary is inspected:

    lex inspect.

If the inspector window shows an empty dictionary then the file lexicon.txt was not found.

Try tagging a sentence:

    NLPtagger pptag: 'The dog ran down the street'

## CategorizationI am using NeoJSON to parse the category word count data.One time initialization:    NLPcategories initializeCategoryHashTry it:     NLPcategories classify: 'The economy is bad and taxes are too high.'## Entity RecognitionFor now just implemented for products, companies, and places. TBD: people's namesOne time initialization:     NLPentities initializeEntitiesExample:    NLPentities entities: 'The Coca Cola factory is in London'
