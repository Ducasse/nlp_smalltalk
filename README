= Natural Language Processing Library for Pharo Smalltalk

== Setup

Copy the files KBSnlp.st and lexicon.txt to the top directory of your Pharo
distribution library. On a Mac, copy them into the App folder that defines
the Pharo application.

Note (5/2/2014): on the Mac, using Pharo 3.0, I had to copy the lexicon.txt file to:

    cp lexicon.txt Contents/Resources

inside the Pharo application.

== Running an example

Open a File Browser and fileIn the KBSnlp.st source file. Open a Class Browser
and and look at the code in the KBnlp class.

Open a Workspace and one time only evaluate:

    NLPtagger initializeLexicon

Note (5/2/2014): after the text file is processed, the lexicon dictionary is inspected:

    lex inspect.

If the inspector window shows an empty dictionary then the file lexicon.txt was not found.

Try tagging a sentence:

    NLPtagger pptag: 'The dog ran down the street'

== To be done

The enclosed code is a simple Smalltalk port of my Java FastTag part of speech
(POS) tagger that is available on my open source page http://markwatson.com/opensource

When/if I have time I will also port my classifier and named entity recognizer (NER) code.
